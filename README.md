# [Project 1: Sales Trends and Customer Ordering Behavior in a Pizza Chain]

This was a personal project where I analyzed sales data from a pizza restaurant to evaluate sales trends and product performance. The goal was to generate actionable insights for business users to improve decision-making on product strategy and operations. The process involved data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization using tools like SQL and Power BI.
